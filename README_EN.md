## ✨ Features

### 💾 Fully Self-Contained Data
Ledger data is stored in your private GitHub/Gitee repository or Web DAV, without any third-party servers. **Multi-user collaboration** via GitHub Collaborator feature, with **incremental sync** mechanism that only uploads/downloads changed data, significantly reducing sync time.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Experience
Long press the recording button for **Voice Recording**, where AI automatically parses amounts, categories, and notes. Configure OpenAI-compatible APIs for intelligent bill analysis, budget suggestions, annual summaries, and **smart predictions** based on historical data.

### 💱 Multi-Currency & Scheduled Billing
Supports 30+ international currencies plus custom currencies, with real-time automatic exchange rate conversion. Perfect for international travel and cross-border transactions. Create **scheduled billing** templates for subscriptions and auto-renewals.

### 📊 Statistics & Visualization

## 🧠 Core Principles

Cent is a "pure frontend" PWA application.  
Apart from GitHub OAuth login, Cent does not rely on any backend services.

Learn more: [Using GitHub as a Database](https://glink25.github.io/post/%E7%8E%B0%E5%9C%A8%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B%E5%B0%86Github%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93/)

### 🗂 Data Structure

- Each ledger (Book) corresponds to a GitHub/Gitee repository.
- Data is stored in JSON format within the repository, supporting historical version rollback.
- Multi-ledger management is achieved by identifying ledgers via repository names.

### 🔁 Incremental Sync Mechanism

Cent incorporates a custom incremental synchronization strategy, only syncing the differential changes:  
- Initial Sync: Full data download.  
- Subsequent Sync: Only transfers newly added or modified parts.  
- Supports offline caching and resume capability.  

This mechanism significantly improves sync efficiency, leading to a smooth and natural collaborative experience.

### 🧩 Extensible Sync Endpoints

The synchronization logic has been abstracted and encapsulated, with future support planned for:  
- Self-hosted Servers  
- Cloud Drives (e.g., Dropbox, OneDrive)  
- Local Offline Ledgers

## 🚀 Deployment and Usage

### Method 1: Use the Online Version Directly

1. Open [https://cent.linkai.work](https://cent.linkai.work)
2. Log in and authorize with GitHub
3. Create a new ledger (a new repository will be created automatically)
4. Start recording transactions 🎉

### Method 2: Self-Deployment

1. Fork this repository  
2. Deploy on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) or any static hosting platform  
3. Manually input your GitHub Token on the login screen to use it  
4. All ledgers and data are stored in your GitHub repositories  

> For security reasons, the self-hosted method cannot support GitHub/Gitee one-click-authentication. You will need to manually generate a token with read and write permissions for the repository (Repo) on the Github/Gitee settings page, and use it through the manual token input feature.
Cent uses Cloudflare Workers to deploy an online authentication service, which only provides services for trusted domains. If you require a quick login service, you can refer to the project [cent-github-backend](https://github.com/glink25/cent-github-backend) to create your own backend service and apply for an OAuth app on the corresponding platform yourself.
